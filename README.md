# mkw-auto-mii-render

CURRENTLY DEPRECATED
I might come back to it one day, but it's already merged with the Auto Boards and I mostly reuse some scripts in other private projects.

This project is meant to one day be merged with https://github.com/GiGGioSo/mkwii-ita-auto-TT-boards.

Currently doesn't work, I wouldn't suggest trying to run it yet.

Thought I'd put it up for a while.
